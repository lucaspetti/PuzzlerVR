# PuzzlerVR

This is a virtual reality app made for Android using C# and MonoDevelop in Unity 3D. In this game, you should click the orbs following the order that they shine.

To install, you just need to open the project using Unity 3D. Version used: 5.5.3. 

I exported this app to Android.

SDK Version: Android 2.3.1 (API Level 9)

This project was made for my VR Nanodegree at Udacity. It took me about two weeks to finish it. The main problem I had was with the game mechanics, which I worked out after looking at the forums and asking a few people about it.
